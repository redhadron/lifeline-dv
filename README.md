This is a python module to help calculate the available Δv for any spaceship based on its dry mass, propellant mass, and specific impulse.

I'll add instructions if anyone is interested!

Todo:  
-split burn into burn and _burn.  
-make error detection in _burn proportional.  
-add validate method to engine.  
-create engine block.  
-make it so that burn can run until a speed is reached or a resource runs out.  
-add tests.  
-add burn time calculations.  
Done:  
-use the same format for resources in all arguments.
