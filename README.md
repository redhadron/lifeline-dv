This is a python module to help calculate the available Δv for any spaceship based on its dry mass, propellant mass, and specific impulse.

I'll add instructions if anyone is interested!

Todo:
-add validate method to engine.
-create engine block.
-split burn into burn and _burn.
-use the same format for resources in all arguments.
-add tests.
